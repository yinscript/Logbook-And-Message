## Logbook And Message Form

This project is a **Logbook and Message Form** application that allows users to enter logs and send messages. It features a simple user interface for logging events and submitting messages, providing an easy way to keep track of entries. ✍️💬

## Features 🌟

- **Real-Time Logbook**: Users can input and record log entries with timestamps, and the data is updated in real-time. 🔄
- **Message Form**: A user interface for submitting messages. 📩

## Weaknesses ⚠️

- **Empty Fields Allowed**: The application currently allows users to enter or record data even when fields are empty. Ideally, the application should prevent submissions with empty fields. 🚫
- **No Log Restrictions**: There are no restrictions preventing users from logging multiple entries if there is already an existing record. The system should ideally restrict multiple log-ins if a record is already present. 🔒
- **Message Form UI Only**: The message form is purely a user interface. Submitted messages can be displayed but cannot be received or stored after submission. ❌📤
